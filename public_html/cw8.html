			<h1>Welcome to Lenny M's homepage</h1>
			<h2>
				I love to nerd out about anything, espically anything
				climate-related.

					My name is Leonid, but everyone calls me Lenny! I&apos;m a
					15 year old student at Stuyvesant High School. I currently
					do full-stack development, but I&apos;m very passionate
					about computer science and I have experience in various
					fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the last couple of years, I&apos;ve been working on
					many full-stack projects and learning about the web
					development field as a whole. I&apos;ve used many JS
					frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc), but my
					favorite one is NEXTjs. I&apos;m using NEXTjs for my this
					site and most of my current projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, much of my work is for the various aspects of my
					Stuyvesant life. I&apos;m an editor for my school&apos;s
					newspaper (<a href="https://stuyspec.com"
						>The Stuyvesant Spectator</a
					>), my school&apos;
					<a href="https://stuysu.org">student union</a> and the
					<a href="https://sophomore.stuysu.org"
						>freshman/sophomore caucus</a
					>, my school computer science classes, and clubs! I&apos;m
					the co-president and co-founder of&nbsp;
					<a href="https://stuylinux.org">Stuy Linux</a>, my
					school&apos;s first club about free software and Linux.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, I still have many side projects, such as my
					personal blog or this personal portfolio site. I have many
					projects, and they range from mobile apps to computer vision
					and analytics systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I participate in many hackathons, and my&nbsp;
					<a href="https://github.com/leomet07">GitHub</a> and
					<a href="https://devpost.com/leomet07">Devpost</a> have many
					entries (with many victories too!)
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of my passion for web development and my experience,
					I have been learning about operating systems, Linux, and the
					free software that makes it all possible.
